| SpamMGR Licensing
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
| Self-hosted installs validate their license against scriptgain.com (the
| software vendor). Responses are RSA-signed; the embedded public key below
| lets this install verify a response was not forged in transit.
|
| Enforcement is intentionally lenient: a failed network check falls back to
| the last good result within the grace window, and the license NEVER hard
| locks the panel. Locking the operator out would block them releasing
| legitimate quarantined mail, so a licensing problem must never become a mail
| problem. Invalid/expired/unlicensed shows a banner instead.
|
| The nodes never talk to this at all. They authenticate to the panel with
| their own key, so licensing lives in exactly one place no matter how many MX
| nodes the operator runs.
